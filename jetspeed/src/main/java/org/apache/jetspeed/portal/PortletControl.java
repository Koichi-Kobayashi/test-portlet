/**
 * The PortletControl acts both as a decoration around a Portlet or PortletSet
 * and also as the window manager for the enclosed Portlet(Set).
 * As such it controls the operation that may be performed on this portlet
 * and whether the portlet content should be displayed or not.
 * PortletControl also delegates all Portlet and PortletSet methods to its
 * inner object and can thus be transparently cascaded or substituted to
 * a simple portlet wherever in a PSML object tree.
